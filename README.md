These sgy files contain single-shot seismic records collected by UAV-based seismic sources in the Kuoqionggangri Glacier (>5500m), Tibet Plateau. 

Seismometer start point: 1000, end point: 1210
Trace spacing: 10 meters, shot spacing: 20 meters, sampling rate: 2 milliseconds

The file name and shot point correspondence is as follows: For example:
35_sc.sgy ~ shot 900 (offset 100m)
33_sc.sgy ~ shot 920 (offset 80m), and so on.
